<button class="collapsible">COVID-19</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
    Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
    <br><br>
    HOW IT SPREADS<br>
    The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
    You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings.

<button class="collapsible">CHOLERA OUTBREAK</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>A bacterial disease causing severe diarrhoea and dehydration, usually spread in water.
    Cholera is fatal if not treated right away.
    Key symptoms are diarrhoea and dehydration. Rarely, shock and seizures may occur in severe cases.
    Treatment includes rehydration, IV fluids and antibiotics<br><br>
    The current outbreak of cholera started on 19th October with its origin being traced to a wedding festival in Kiambu County which later spread across Kiambu (31), Nairobi (17), Murang’a (1), Kajiado (2), Nakuru (2) and Uasin Gishu (8) counties. The disease has been relatively low in terms of cases and in most of the counties controlled through the county level actions by the health department and with support from partners.

    There has however been a concerning increase of cholera cases with worrying trends in death rates due to over stretched capacity of the local governments, KRCS local branches and partners to effectively respond. The increased cases are mainly within Nairobi and in counties that are currently reporting persistent drought, communities utilizing unsafe water sources and limited access to sanitation and hygiene services and corresponding poor WASH practices.
    
    In particular, Nairobi, Tana River, Garissa and Wajir counties have recently reported increased caseloads with reported highest mortalities in Nairobi, Garissa, Tana River and Wajir counties.
    
    During the initial phase of the outbreak, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, Kajiado, Muranga and Kiambu responded effectively with the outbreak contained in Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Kajiado. Nairobi county government together with KRCS Nairobi branch and other partners sustained interventions but unfortunately the CFR has now risen to a concerning 5%. The gaps identified in Nairobi center on limited community level sensitization and WASH interventions as well as overburdened case management rea the leading causes identified for the high CFR.</p>

<button class="collapsible">CANCER</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 

    Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways. For instance, cancer cells:

    grow in the absence of signals telling them to grow. Normal cells only grow when they receive such signals. 
    ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die (a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis).
    invade into nearby areas and spread to other areas of the body. Normal cells stop growing when they encounter other cells, and most normal cells do not move around the body. 
    tell blood vessels to grow toward tumors.  These blood vessels supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products from tumors.
    hide from the immune system. The immune system normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells. 
    trick the immune system into helping cancer cells stay alive and grow. For instance, some cancer cells convince immune cells to protect the tumor instead of attacking it.
    accumulate multiple changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts. Some cancer cells have double the normal number of chromosomes.
    rely on different kinds of nutrients than normal cells. In addition, some cancer cells make energy from nutrients in a different way than most normal cells. This lets cancer cells grow more quickly.<br>You can reduce your risk of getting cancer by making healthy choices like keeping a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, limiting the amount of alcohol you drink, and protecting your skin.</p>

<button class="collapsible">MATERNAL HEALTH</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. 

    Each stage should be a positive experience, ensuring women and their babies reach their full potential for health and well-being. 
    
    Although important progress has been made in the last two decades, about 295 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. This number is unacceptably high.
    
    The most common direct causes of maternal injury and death are excessive blood loss, infection, high blood pressure, unsafe abortion, and obstructed labour, as well as indirect causes such as anemia, malaria, and heart disease. 
    
    Most maternal deaths are preventable with timely management by a skilled health professional working in a supportive environment. 
    
    Ending preventable maternal death must remain at the top of the global agenda. At the same time, simply surviving pregnancy and childbirth can never be the marker of successful maternal health care. It is critical to expand efforts reducing maternal injury and disability to promote health and well-being.
    
    Every pregnancy and birth is unique. Addressing inequalities that affect health outcomes, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender, is fundamental to ensuring all women have access to respectful and high-quality maternity care.<br><br>
  Recommendend maternal health practices<br>
  During and after pregnancy, mothers should receive continuous care from a physician, in-person or via telehealth depending on the need,[87] to monitor the growth and status of the fetus. Maternal health organizations suggest that at a minimum pregnant women should receive one ultrasound at week 24 to help predict any possible growth anomalies and prevent future gestational concerns.[82] It is also stated that pregnant women should also fulfill any missing vaccinations as soon as possible including the tetanus vaccine and influenza vaccine.[88][89] For pregnant women who are at an increased risk for preeclampsia, one could take a dietary supplement of low dose aspirin as prophylaxis before 20 weeks gestation.[82] Pregnant women should also monitor their blood sugars as they are able to monitor the potential development of gestational diabetes. Other prenatal screening tests include serum integrated protein tests, cell free DNA blood tests to check for chromosomal abnormalities, and nuchal translucency ultrasounds. If their medical system is able to provide them, mothers can also undergo more invasive diagnostic tests such as an amniocentesis, or chorionic villous sampling to detect abnormalities with greater accuracy.<br><br></p>
